The Mantel test was used to investigate the relationship between genetic distance, geography, and different environmental variables on dataset II (available on Figshare https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24710961.v1).

The genetic distance matrix was constructed from ANI matrix as 1-ANI, geographic distance matrix was generated from geographic coordinates with the R package geosphere, and the environmental matrices with euclidean method.
Raw environmental variables are in the file Environmental variables all.csv

Phylogenetic signal indices Pagel's Î» and Blomberg's K were measured with R packages geiger and picante respectively.
