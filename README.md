# The global speciation continuum of the cyanobacterium _Microcoleus_

A collection of files used in my project focused on the population genomics of cyanobateria _Microcoleus_. The script were used in the paper Stanojković A., Skoupý S., Johannesson, H., & Dvořák, P. (full citation soon)

We sought to investigate the evolutionary forces contributing to the emergence of the global continuum of 12 _Microcoleus_ species from a global dataset of this group.

Our prior work, [Stanojkovic et al. 2022](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09670262.2021.2007420?casa_token=cXWIMXlZHJcAAAAA%3A7KLJIIbJQb0r_RDy2HqXM6HjV36NeO4oyGfdI9B5mHjknKU51E-KLv08_JB4k84qXwViVMzqOSh-Puc), suggested that the diversification of the _Microcoleus_ group may have been influenced by geographic and ecological processes (based on the analysis of 16S rRNA and 16S-23S ITS). We estimated that Microcoleus is consisted of at least 13 distinct lineages. This study was necessary to establish a comprehensive, global collection culture of almost 500 _Microcoleus_ strains originating from various regions worldwide (excluding South America) and unravel the genetic structure of this global sample. Our current study reconstructed the genetic structure based on [Stanojkovic et al. 2022](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09670262.2021.2007420?casa_token=cXWIMXlZHJcAAAAA%3A7KLJIIbJQb0r_RDy2HqXM6HjV36NeO4oyGfdI9B5mHjknKU51E-KLv08_JB4k84qXwViVMzqOSh-Puc) findings, focusing on a subset of 202 _Microcoleus_ strains for whole genome sequencing. Such an approach provided us with a priori information for subsequent population genomic analyses.

Delineating prokaryotic species has been challenging due to cryptic species diversity, limited population-level sampling, and poorly articulated species concepts. While some approaches like ANI or 16S rRNA (dis)similarity thresholds provide pragmatic solutions, they fail to capture the intricate evolutionary processes and the dynamics of evolutionary changes over time. To address this, we have recently developed a novel approach in [Kollár et al. 2022](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.16218) called the universal, probabilistic concept of evolutionary lineages (UPCEL). UPCEL applies the genome fractions resistant to gene flow between evolving species as an indicator of divergence probability. Rather than categorizing species into discrete units, UPCEL describes their divergence using the probability at a given time, placing them along the speciation continuum.

We chose soil-dwelling filamentous cyanobacterium _Microcoleus vaginatus_ as our study system due to its near ubiquity, distinctive morphological characteristics from other cyanobacteria, and the presence of many recently diverged, closely related groups. This makes it an ideal candidate for investigating the diversification as well as the emergence of new species.
